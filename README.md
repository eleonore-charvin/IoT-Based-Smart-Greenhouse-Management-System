## IoT-Based-Smart-Greenhouse-Management-System

The proposed IoT platform is designed to provide smart monitoring of the
greenhouseâ€™s internal environment. It collects data from temperature and soil
moisture sensors, processes them, and automates watering and activation of the
cooling and heating systems. The system optimizes plant growth while
minimizing water and energy consumption. The platform offers unified interfaces
(through both REST and MQTT) to integrate the greenhouse into Smart
Gardening and Smart Agriculture ecosystems. Finally, the platform provides end-
users with historical data on environmental measures of the greenhouse for
informed decision-making and allows them to apply some changes.
Summarizing, the main features it offers are:
- Automated watering of each plant based on temperature and specific
plant needs,
- Automated activation of the cooling and heating systems when the
temperature falls outside a predefined range,
- Updates of the water requirements of each plant, either based on the
average temperature over the last five days, or upon user request,
- Unified interfaces (REST Web Services and MQTT) for system
integration,
- End-user application for displaying historical data on the greenhouse's
internal environment.
